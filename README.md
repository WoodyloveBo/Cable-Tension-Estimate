# Cable-Tension-Estimate

## Overview

This project aims to estimate the cable tension acting on a quadrotor by constructing a physical system consisting of a drone, spring, and payload. Instead of using direct force sensors, we infer tension through spring deformation, allowing for a lightweight and cost-effective solution.

### System Architecture
- Platform : Crazyflie 2.1 nano quadrotor + Thrust Upgrade Bundle
